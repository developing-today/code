# @prelude//prelude.bzl -- Global import shim.
#
# NOTE: this module is handled in a special way by Buck2; anything exported here
# by using a public symbol name is available in *all* BUILD files, available to
# use in ALL other targets! This is very powerful, and also an easy footgun.
#
# It is VERY IMPORTANT that you do not add unnecessary top-level exportable
# declarations here. The reason for this is largely pretty simple: code
# cleanliness. Import time is one thing, but even then it is much, much more
# preferable to explicitly import the symbols and rules you need directly from a
# well defined module, versus cluttering the global scope with endless rules and
# functions and macros. This just makes all code easier to read and understand.
#
# For the most part, the only thing this should *really* export is things that
# are globally useful to BUILD files in user code, as well as useful
# declarations for out-of-line `.bzl` files. (The upstream buck2-prelude itself
# uses this magic file to export all global rules and many other things, which
# is apparently considered (by them) to be an anti-feature these days, but a
# necessary one for buck1 compatibility. So this is one thing we can do better.)
#
# NOTE: the symbols exported here *are not implicitly included* in the `.bzl`
# files located inside the prelude// cell; that would be an obvious recursive
# import error, so prelude code must `load()` symbols explicitly. It is only
# `.bzl` files outside of the prelude// cell, and BUILD files, which have these
# symbols available.
#
# REMEMBER: Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball, and do not add things to this file
# unless absolutely necessary.
