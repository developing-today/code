- alias
  - zulip -> https://developing-today.zulipchat.com
  - git -> https://github.com/developing-today/code
- allow [ "TXT" "domain.name" ]
- setup alias to work as provider
- check in on porkbun provider issues
- personal dns?
- compile list of domains, list of subdomains
- run delete all records for domain/subdomain/type for each in list until all deleted
- go section by section applying and adding new domains with terraform
- allow DNSConfig to be an array.
  - current issue is that both finalStructure and condensed rely on '@' items directly
  - need to refactor to allow for multiple DNSConfig items
  - ideally generate each finalstructure and then merge and then generate condensed
  - but maybe implement merge for both finalstructure and condensed
