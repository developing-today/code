## Summary of Conversation

### Task
Review the "Phase 1 Part 2 Steps 1-5" implementation that re-keys collab sessions by filename (instead of hash) in the Rust backend of the `pkgs/id` crate.

### What Was Done — Review Checks Performed

1. **`cargo check`** — ✅ Compiles cleanly
2. **`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`** — ✅ Passes with no warnings
3. **`cargo fmt --check`** — ❌ **FAILS** — Multiple formatting issues in `collab.rs` and `routes.rs` (long lines that need wrapping per rustfmt rules)
4. **`cargo test --lib`** — ✅ 408 unit tests pass
5. **`cargo test` (integration)** — ❌ 2 pre-existing integration test failures (`serve_tests::test_serve_parallel_isolation_a` and `_b`) — these appear unrelated to this change
6. **Template tests** — ⚠️ The `web::templates::tests` module tests are **not running** (0 tests matched filter `web::templates::tests`). The web module tests appear to be behind a feature gate — they aren't compiled in the default test configuration. The tests at lines 1025, 1038, 1051, 1060 of `templates.rs` still call `render_editor` with **3 arguments** (old signature), but the function now takes **4 arguments** (added `hash`). This would be a compile error if the tests were actually compiled.

### Key Findings

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Broken tests in `templates.rs`** — Lines 1025, 1038, 1051, 1060 call `render_editor("abc123", "test.md", "<p>hello</p>")` with 3 args, but signature is now `render_editor(doc_id, name, content, hash)` requiring 4. These tests don't currently compile under the web feature gate but must be fixed.
2. **`cargo fmt` violations** — Several long lines in `collab.rs` (lines ~652, 663, 674) and `routes.rs` (lines ~393, 403, 412, 502, 511) need reformatting.

**Unused parameter concern:**
- `handle_collab_socket` still takes `filename: Option<String>` parameter (line 648) but never uses it — `doc_id` is now the filename. This param was from the old `WsParams.filename` and is now redundant. Clippy didn't flag it (perhaps because it's passed from the upgrade handler), but it's dead code.

**Logical correctness (verified):**
- Sessions are correctly keyed by filename in `CollabState.documents` HashMap
- `get_or_create` takes `(filename, hash, initial_content)` — keys by filename ✅
- `notify_new_version` looks up by filename, updates stored hash after broadcast ✅
- `handle_collab_socket` resolves filename→hash via `get_hash_for_name` ✅
- `save_handler` calls `notify_new_version(&req.name, &new_hash_str)` ✅
- `render_editor` and `render_editor_page` properly pass `hash` as separate param ✅
- Template emits `data-doc-id` (now filename), `data-filename`, and `data-hash` attributes ✅
- Blob download link correctly uses `hash_escaped` ✅

### Files Modified
- `pkgs/id/src/web/collab.rs` — Document struct, get_or_create, notify_new_version, handle_collab_socket
- `pkgs/id/src/web/routes.rs` — get_hash_for_name visibility, edit_handler, save_handler
- `pkgs/id/src/web/templates.rs` — render_editor, render_editor_page signatures + data attributes

### What Needs To Be Done Next
1. **Fix `cargo fmt`** — Run `cargo fmt` in `pkgs/id/`
2. **Fix broken template tests** — Update 4 test calls in `templates.rs` (lines 1025, 1038, 1051, 1060) to pass a 4th `hash` argument
3. **Remove or use the `filename` parameter** in `handle_collab_socket` — it's now unused since `doc_id` serves as the filename
4. **Consider the `render_editor_page` docstring** at line 514-516 which still says `doc_id` is "Document identifier (hash)" — should be updated to say it's the filename now
