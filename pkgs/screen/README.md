success is making this tutorial using roc
- https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-1/
with WAN access available for
```
ssh ascii
ssh unicode
ssh kitty # sorry sixel mitchell hashimoto says you should retire
# actually maybe it should be text and then various
#    buffers - ssh/websocket/raylib/image
#    outputs - ascii unicode kitty tinyvg
#    modes   - main/alternate (persistent|ephemeral)-session
# ssh may also include websocket/web-text modes
# ssh should accept main and alternate screen buffer
# ssh should allow something like interactive mode in alternate screen
# ssh should allow direct response from main screen
#    defaulting to closing session after response
#    allow call-response reusing session with a renewable ttl
#    possibly just directly redirect nats stream into screen
#    data formats could grow interactive/kdl/json/jsonl/xml/automerge/csv/tsv/sparql/duckdb/sql/json-ld/turtle/protobuf/grpc/capnproto/flatbuffers/atom/rss/gopher/irc/gemini/spartan/telnet/other-smol-things/activitypub/bluesky-at/ftp/scp/
raylib
# actually maybe video or video/raylib (and image image/raylib)
# raylib should work on windows,mac, and linux
# standard roc sdk comes with a variety of built-in libraries
# variations with more less or no additions possibly? raytrace/geometry/physics/multiplayer/etc.
html (or maybe web?)
# may need variations for
#   htmx/sshText equivalents like web-text
#   things like canvas websockets
#   full has everything 
htmx # alias for web-htmx or html-htmx
websocket # NATS

##
# possible future things 
## 
# imgui
# bevy 
# egui
# custom client & protocol (or alternate websocket mode?) 
# s3/seaweed/crud/rest 
# ?vnc?? 
# ssh-terminal ?? the gang reverse-shells themselves 
# rdf triples , ISO/IEC 39075 GQL / opencypher
# other things in the data formats note for ssh/text
# other binary/performance types of formats/modes
# tokens/tigerbeetle-accounts # lol,lmao.
# better font
# control/effects
# better color control for text/grid
# play with authz/rbac
# namespaces/id
# chat / local client / raylib-full-control_multi-window-in-game-window-control
