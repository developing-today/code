// ExecIdentity says which program a stdio server's command runs, as of now.
//
// PoolID describes the configuration; it cannot see a binary that changed
// underneath an unchanged command. `npx`, `uvx` and a nix profile that
// re-points `~/.nix-profile/bin/foo` all keep the same command, args and env
// while the program behind them moves, so a pool keyed by PoolID alone kept
// running the old program until somebody restarted the daemon.
//
// The identity is what the file holds, not where it is: its content hash when
// it is small, and its device, inode, size, mtime and mode when it is not. A
// symlink re-pointed at a byte-identical file is the same program and keeps
// its child. A re-pointed link to a different file is a different program,
// whatever its path, because its bytes or its inode differ. The stat fallback
// keeps a large program, such as a node binary, from being read whole on every
// check. An in-place rewrite changes size or mtime in practice; a replacement
// changes the inode.
//
// The identity is "" for a server that is not a child process, and begins
// with "missing:" when the command does not resolve. A missing command is
// its own identity, so the pool still starts and fails the way it always did,
// and it is replaced when the command appears.
