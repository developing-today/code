# TODO

- Replace the takeover handoff with a supervisor that owns each stdio child's pipes for the child's whole life. The current handoff is a stopgap: `mcpx upgrade` (run from the new binary) and `mcpx daemon --takeover` have the old daemon start the successor as its own child, so it stays in the service's cgroup, and pass its children's pipes to it over a unix socket. Every handoff depends on the framing, the ack sequence and the restore path working. A supervisor that outlives the daemon would make a daemon upgrade a plain restart of the front end.
- Streamable HTTP upstream sessions survive a takeover; SSE upstream sessions do not, because their standalone GET stream cannot be moved between processes. Those are closed and re-initialised on the successor's first call.
- A cold restart does not resume upstream sessions. The lease table is restored from `sessions.json`, but the upstream `Mcp-Session-Id` is kept only in memory and in the takeover handoff, so after a restart each HTTP upstream is initialised again.
- An upstream session whose server is removed from the configuration during a takeover is not adopted and expires upstream on its own; it is not DELETEd.
