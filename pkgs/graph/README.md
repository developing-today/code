plan is as follows

- make a website which basically gives prepared query access to a sqlite database
- use go for backend
- allow libsql or turso backend for sqlite
- maybe allow 'curl' sqlite and use as libsql
- attach to a database, run queries from that point.
- make website pretty with htmx and tailwind
- make a starter database
- make a neo4j graph thing
- put each database in the graph thing
- relate all things to each other somehow?
- location? specific metadata? psuedorandomly? manually?
- make website able to cypher
- ratelimiting
- acl / auth / login
- users still attach to one database in web ui
- user(userOriginDb) + attachedDatabase = what is allowed
- to access the system: <database> <user> <?password/2fa/whatever/secretSauce?>
- this leaves you attaches to <database>
- then you can attach<database2>
- database2 auth? to start, all databases will be public. all information public.
- after you can connect to any which database and query multiple databases with cypher and stuff
- come back and input real auth
- oh god nix buck deploying with nixos i might die
